 * 2) Once the wait() is over, consumer removes an element in taskQueue and called
 * notifyAll() method. Because the last-time wait() method was called by producer thread
 * (that’s why producer is in waiting state), producer gets the notification.
 * 3) Producer thread after getting notification, if ready to produce the element
