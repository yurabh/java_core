/**
 * http://howtodoinjava.com/core-java/multi-threading/how-to-work-with-wait-notify-and-notifyall-in-java/
 * 1) Here “produce(counter++)” code has been written inside infinite loop so that producer
 * keeps producing elements at regular interval.
 * 2) We have written the produce() method code following the general guideline to write wait()
 * method as mentioned in first section.
 * 3) Once the wait() is over, producer add an element in taskQueue and called notifyAll()
 * method. Because the last-time wait() method was called by consumer thread (that’s why producer
 * is out of waiting state), consumer gets the notification.
 * 4) Consumer thread after getting notification, if ready to consume the element as per written logic.
 * 5) Note that both threads use sleep() methods as well for simulating time delays
 * in creating and consuming elements.
